Let's come back to plan as real plan :

(1) This would be useful so I mentioned the same as example.
(2) Real question people will ask :  Why do I need this ?  Why should I go for the same ?
(3) Some takeway :  If I really need a small amount of money.  I have ten cards along with credit card.  Why should I go for a ATM like this ??
(4) But actually this would be awesome if i think exchanging the earned cryto in terms of money.  So it will work.  But it will not work to fullfill 
the need of an actual ATM.  We do not need it.
(5) Second aspect you did not discuss:  Crypto earning and exchanges occurs in large amount of money.  Crypto makes more sense for large volume 
transactions.  Earning or loss goes very high or very low.  Therefore, withdrawing the money from ATM may not make sense or make sense by withdrawing 
small as usual.
(6) Users of vitual currency is very less.  But will improve.
(7) As a business I rate it high for next 6 years in India.
(8) There is real risk in terms of legal, Government intervention, acceptance in large community etc.
(9) Still I would prefer to go for it.  Future would slowly turn towards it as inflation enemy would attack the economy.  

Take this work as Inflation pandemic ready solution....
