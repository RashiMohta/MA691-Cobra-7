**Objective**
The aim of our project is to predict the survival function for patients diagnosed with breast cancer. 

**Dataset**
We  have  used  the  German  Breast  CancerStudy Group 2 (gbcsg) dataset for our analysis. 

We estimated the survival function for all the patients using simple survival trees and a modified version of COBRA which gives the combined outcome of several survival trees. Finally, we calculate the integrated brier score for both the models and compare their results.
